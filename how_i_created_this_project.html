    <P>To make this project ,I took a course on <b>udemy</b> by <b>colt steel</b> on web development bootcamp, because
        we had quizes this week
        i could only
        learn html,css and some javascipt.I also learnt some css styling from <b>W3 Schools</b> because they had more
        concise information.
    </P>
    <P>This web dev project was made mainly using html and css and is based on football club barcelona(could not think
        of anything better),hope you found it intresting.</P>
